or the GNU General Public License (license/license_GPL.txt). With the dual-
licensing scheme, linking certain components with GPL-licensed libraries will
require the combined work to be distributed under the GPL. Namely, components
not incorporating source code from the "src_extensions", "native/src/sharedx",
or "native/include/sharedx" directory hierarchies are distributable under the
BSD; otherwise, they are distributable under the GPL.

Other libraries have been incorporated to varying extents:

  * Components of JAMA (license/license_JAMA.txt) have been adapted into:
    * native/src/shared/LinearAlgebraOps_eigs.cpp
    * native/src/shared/LinearAlgebraOps_lu.cpp
    * native/src/shared/LinearAlgebraOps_svd.cpp
    * src/org/shared/array/kernel/LinearAlgebraOps.java
  * Components of Kiss FFT (license/license_Kiss-FFT.txt) have been adapted
    into:
    * src/org/shared/fft/FftOps.java
  * The Bitstream Vera font (license/license_Bitstream-Vera.txt) is included at:
    * src/font/Vera.ttf
  * The FFTW3 library (optional, license/license_FFTW3.txt) is used by:
    * native/include/sharedx/Plan.hpp
    * native/src/sharedx/Plan.cpp
    Important: Linking against this library will cause the combined work to be
    distributed under the GPL.
